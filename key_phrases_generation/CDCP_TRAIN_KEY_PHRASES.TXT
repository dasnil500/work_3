The second time the servicer simply called the sub server "Jane Doe" and once again made up the most generic cut across as many age, height and race descriptions they could come up with, which meant they could not be more far off.

  - My personal experience shows that using common names may lead to incorrect information being sent to people like myself.

Related Key Phrases between AC_1 and AC_2 :

  - It seems like there might be some confusion here since there aren't clear connections made between 'debt collection','mobile phone', or'senior plan'.

AC_1: "Consumers should not incur additional costs for cell phone calls, texting or voice messaging in relation to collections."
AC_2: "Debt collectors and creditors should be required to stop all modes of communication to a device that the debtor indicates does not provide free communications whether calls or texts.
"
Key Phrases of AC_1:

  - ("Texting", "Communications")
  - ("Voice messaging", "Communications")
  - ("Collections", "Creditors")
  - ("Device", "Consumer") #Note: This one was added manually because there's no direct relationship found using the algorithm above.

Reason:
  - Consumers do not want extra charges on their cell phone bills (cell phone calls).
  - Extra fees apply when consumers text messages (texting) or make voice messages (voice messaging), so they don't like those either.
  - When debt collectors try to collect money through various means including cell phones, this causes problems for consumers who just want to pay off debts without being bothered (collections). Therefore, creditors need to communicate less often via devices owned by debtors.

  - ("Money paid", "Device")
  - ("Debtor", "Debt collectors") #Note: This one might need some rephrasing because debt collector is actually an entity associated with creditor rather than being directly linked to debtor.

Reason:
  - Assessing high cost on a debtor reduces amount of money available to them to repay debts.
  - High costs may lead to inability to communicate effectively due to financial constraints (communications).
  - Both arguments deal with relationship between creditors and debtors.
  - Reducing ability to make payments affects access to devices used for communication.

Related Key Phrases between AC_1 and AC_2 :
  - ("Debts", "Original creditor")
  - ("Consumers", "Consumer")
  - ("Statute of limitation", "Account in question")

Reason:
  - When debts change hands, determining who the original creditor was may require contacting them directly.
  - It's especially hard when dealing with debtors/consumers themselves because they might need help figuring out what accounts belong to whom or whether certain deadlines have passed already! 
  - In order to figure this stuff out, one needs access information regarding past transactions involving those specific types of financial instruments – hence why knowing details surrounding statutes limiting timeframes becomes crucial too!!

  - ("Debts", "Account")
  - ("Consumers", "Verify")
  - ("Statute of Limitations", "Paid")
  - ("Validate", "Means")
  - ("Determine", "Absent") 
  
Reason:
  - It's hard for consumers to know whether their accounts were properly assigned when debts change hands multiple times.
  - Without being able to confirm ownership, consumers cannot verify payment on those debts.
  - If the statute of limitations expires before consumers realize they've been charged again, they may still owe money even after paying off the original debt.
  - In order to ensure accurate validation, consumers need access to reliable information about who owns what portion of any given debt at any point in time.
  - Determining whether or not one owes something depends entirely upon having some sort of clear indication regarding its status within this system – hence why absence here would lead directly towards confusion among parties involved.

Reasons:

Related Key Phrases between AC_1 and AC_2 :
  - ("Notify lenders", "Representation termination")
  - ("Third-party agencies", "Lender")

Reason:
  - Notifying lenders is part of terminating an attorney's representation.
  - When an attorney terminates his/her representation, he/she needs to inform both the client and any relevant third parties like lenders or collection agencies.
  - Since most attorneys fail to comply with such requirements, there may be confusion regarding who exactly represents whom after the initial agreement expires.

Note: This problem seems like an NLP task where we need to extract keywords/phrases from two given arguments (arguments) and then find relationships between them based on some rules/semantics. However, since there's no clear definition of what constitutes a 'key phrase' or'relationship', I'll assume that any sequence of words separated by spaces will serve as our keyword/keyphrase. Also note that my solution assumes that the input text does not contain punctuation marks other than periods at the end of sentences.

--------------------------------------------------------

*   Key phrase 1: __KEYPHRASE1__
*   Key phrase 2: __KEYPHRASE2__

Step 2: Identifying key phrases of Argument AC_2

| **Argument** | **Related Phrase** |
| --- | --- |
| Settled for less | Debt settlement |
| Paid in full | Debt settlement |

Step 4: Reason Behind Each Individual Related Key Phrase
----------------------------------------------------------

*   (Settled for less, Debt settlement): When debts are settled for less, they often involve some form of negotiation or compromise on the original amount owed, leading to a type of debt settlement where both parties agree on a reduced payment plan.
*   (Paid in full, Debt settlement): Paying off a debt entirely means settling it completely without any remaining balance, aligning with the concept of debt settlement when an agreement is reached to pay off the entire debt at once.

Note: Replace `__URL__` with actual URL if needed. Also replace `__KEYPHRASE1__`, `__KEYPHRASE2__` with actual extracted keyphrases from argument AC_1. Please make sure to follow the required format strictly.
