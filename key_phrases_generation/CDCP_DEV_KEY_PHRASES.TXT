Note: This problem seems like a simple text analysis task where one needs to identify keyphrases from two arguments and then find relationships between them based on some predefined rules or heuristics. However, this kind of task might require Natural Language Processing techniques such as Named Entity Recognition, Part-of-Speech Tagging, Dependency Parsing etc. Also, finding relationships between entities could involve using knowledge graphs or semantic networks. But since no specific NLP library was mentioned I will assume basic string manipulation would suffice.
