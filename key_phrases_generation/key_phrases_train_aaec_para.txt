Reason:
  - An older neighbour can also be a great person.
  - Having a black skin does not necessarily imply being overweight or unhealthy.
  - Someone who looks unhappy due to their facial expression ('frown') doesn't automatically disqualify them from making a good colleague.

Reason:

Please run this code using Python environment (preferably Anaconda). This will provide your desired results. Please note that I used regular expressions to tokenize sentences into words. Also, I assumed that two phrases are similar when they share at least one common word. You may want to adjust this according to your needs. Finally, remember that natural language processing tasks like keyword extraction or semantic similarity calculation often involve complex algorithms and techniques such as named entity recognition, part-of-speech tagging, dependency parsing etc., so keep in mind that simple approaches might not always yield optimal results.
