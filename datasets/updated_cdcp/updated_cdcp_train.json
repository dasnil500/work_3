As someone who has answered a company phone, you can tell a caller that the employee cannot take calls or that they don't work there, but that caller will repeatedly call back. My position on this is simple,  if the creditor does not call to confirm employment before credit is issued, they should not call after the debt is in collection. If they confirm employment then they could also inquire about the communication policy. Personally, I am in a position of constant public contact with no available phone with me and it would be hard to immpossible to have a phone conversation without leaving my work area which would cause issues with management for my job.",

This does not mean a consumer no longer owes a debt. I do agree with the fact that a debt collector must notify the creditor of disputes. As a matter of fact, legitimate debt collectors do this on a regular basis. As a debt collector typically does not own the debt, they're unable to control what a creditor does with that information, all they are currently able to do is implement internal controls that protect the consumer and the agency.

Many of these are beyond the statute of limitations to file suit  but suit is filed anyway. Many consumers don't know to file an answer is court  and a default judgment is entered. The information you suggest would help a lot in letting consumers know what this debt is. I would include the trail of ownership of the debt as there could be intermediary owners between the original creditor and final collector. Debts are sold and resold.

        "paragraph": "Collectors are responsible for re-establishing contact with delinquent customers and providing services that facilitate repayment of the loans, regardless of the technology utilized. In Collections, automated dialing systems effectively increase the ability for the collector to reach delinquent customers unwilling to proactively reach out to the creditors. Automated dialing systems are used in many other ways not related to debt collection: telemarketers use them to reach potential customers, schools use them to notify parents of closings due to inclement weather. The technology is the same but the intent is different based on the user. The Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA) prohibits creditors from using automated dialing systems to call cell phone numbers without consent from the customer. The TCPA\"s original purpose, protecting consumers from costly charges as a result of automated calls, has been subsumed by the new goal of preventing overly numerous call attempts to a number that (generally) is directly connected to the customer. It does not change the purpose of collection calls,  it merely makes the process less efficient. Regulating which numbers can be called using an automated dialing system is also counter to the growing reality of wireless-only households. According to the Center for Disease Control's 'Wireless Substitution' latest report (Early release data, July-December 2012), over one third (36%) of adults in the United States live in a household with only wireless telephone service. That figure is even higher (45%) when you look at children living in the US. With an average annualized growth rate of 34%, it is conceivable that sometime before 2020 only a minority of the country's adults will be living in households with a landline telephone that can be autodialed. The CFPB should allow for the autodialing of all telephone numbers provided by the customer without byzantine consent requirements. Regardless of whether it is at application or during the course of normal business, once the number is provided by the customer to the creditor, that number should be considered another viable option for collection.",

This position would motivate the litigant to ensure their facts were correct before any filing took place. This position would allow CFPB to review cases filed no matter how they were adjudicated by the involved court. This review could be conducted at CFPB offices since it only requires the original filings. This review could be initiated simply based on a complaint to the agency's offices. The penalty could be adjustable based on a variety of agency standards.

Even if collectors are allowed to continue litigation (which I do not see going away,) there must be a penalty for the collector if false claim is made. If a collector starts litigation and it is found to be against the wrong person, compensation and additional penalty should be paid by the entity initiating the litigation in the form of a reasonable fee to the victim and an additional (and substantial) fee to the governing authority to help cover oversight expenses. To the second question, I believe an overwhelmingly large portion of consumer debt can be repaid. However, there are always going to be exceptions to this. In cases where debt can not be collected for whatever reason, it should be written off as truly not collectable and no not be allow to be sold again as debt to be collected. Fine tuning and definitions of \"Not Collectable\" will have to be worked out by the appropriate oversight bureau or agency. To the third question, both party's must be measured. There are currently established credit reporting agencies to monitor the consumer side of this issue and an additional, numerical evaluation score can be added to the consumer's already established credit report. That would be a starting point that can be expanded on as the system is fine tuned. The collector, on the other hand, would require a new measuring system that would not only score the company as a whole, but the individuals taking part in any debt resolution activities. For successful examples of such a system I would direct you to the Department of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and their Compliance-Safety-Accountability system. Admittedly, their system is much more complex and dives much deeper than would be required for the debt industry. However, their point system is valid and flexible for future change. It would also allow for measurement of the initial creditor. Such measurement would give the government and investors a better idea of a given business' risk level. Add to this mix, the recommendations from Mr. Bartmann and you have a system whereby collectors and financial institutions will better regulate themselves to achieve an ethical and responsible outcome and not hide behind the \"what I did was legal\" defense. It would be a Win-Win for both sides and bring many consumers out of the debt death spiral. Lastly, the federal government could implement this system with a minimal impact on state autonomy. It would reduce the number of litigation in state and local courts, thereby motivating the states to take part.",

In 2004 I completed my college education and consolidated all of my student loans through Nelnet. In 2005 (or so) I started to get calls from debt collectors stating that I was delinquent on my loan repayment. I explained the situation, that I had made all of my timely payments through Nelnet and, before I would pay anything else, I would need to see some proof of the debt. I never received any proof of the debt  and this conversation reoccurred several times for the next five years. In 2011 I wanted to buy my (wife\"s) dream home. It was a significant purchase  and the bankers I talked with indicated I needed to clear up the student loan issue to be approved. I reached out to the original creditor and the debt collector and begged for some proof of the loan. They then provided me with a loan application (nothing to indicate that the application was approved or that any funds were ever dispersed to me). While I was not comfortable with the proof,  I knew that fighting it out in court would take longer than I was willing to take. So, I was very purposeful in my conversations with the original creditor and the debt collector to make sure that the issue would be cleared on my credit report if I paid the full value of the (alleged) loan. I also recorded the conversations I had with the original creditor and the debt collector. I paid the original loan amount  and (if you didn't see this coming) the original creditor refused to update my credit report. And, even after providing the credit reporting agencies with proof that the debt was paid, they also refused to update my credit report. To make matters worse, after the debt was paid, I received a notice from the debt collector that several thousands of dollars had been excused. I immediately contacted the debt collector and requested documentation that would support their amount due, including documentation where I agreed to a specific interest rate. No response from the debt collector. So, I am now arguing it out with the IRS regarding any additional taxes that may be due. And, even though I paid the debt two years ago, my credit report has not yet been updated. It is simply ridiculous than any business would have this much power to have such a negative impact on an individual without any documentation to back it up. Any creditor should be required to provide certain documentation prior to making a negative credit reporting and there should be significant consequences for any creditor/debt collector that pursues a debt without having the required documentation.",

The Court cannot give legal advice so it is saddening to have to try and explain and console upset litigants who have no idea what they are in for. I think there should be more avenues for pro se litigants who cannot afford to retain a private attorney  (which is 95 % of the litigants in my city). I can say that most people do not answer summonses because they either were not properly served or they just straight up do not care, or most often, do not understand the legalese. BUT, I do have to say that I get many litigants who call and ask what they do now that they are served. On the occasions that people do file answers, most of them are in letter form, not a \"legal\" verified answer. Most debt collection attorneys jump right on that and request a summary judgment. Our Court does not turn away letters,  and we send a copy to the attorney and set the matter up for a pre trial conference with a judge or court attorney to help try to get both parties together to come to some sort of resolution. The Court does have to adhere to a scheduling policy for these conferences,  but we are very flexible  if a defendant has a scheduling conflict we try to accommodate them as best we can. When summonses are filed with the court, half of them have tons of information about the debt, others only have the amount due! I find that sometimes it's hard for litigants to obtain further proving documents from attorneys, even with the court telling them they have to. When entering default judgments, I take my time and examine the whole file, like comparing the contents of the summons/complaint and the default judgment submitted, re-checking the affidavit of service of the summons (to make sure the defendant had the legal time to answer the summons), and ensuring that attached to the default judgment is the proper documentation as to purchasing the debt, a non-military affidavit, etc. I also make sure that they are being charged the proper interest rate and court costs. The bottom line is that the debtors still do not have enough and/or sufficient laws to protect them, and the Court's hands are tied based on these laws, even if they wanted to help, they couldn't. I know the Court is to remain impartial, but in a small city, everybody knows everybody and sometimes it's hard to see these practices occurring.",

The blocked caller ID was \"1 Unavailable,\" which is designed to outfox call-blocking from the recipient's end, and makes it impossible to identify the caller using reverse number lookups and the like.

I then looked them up on the internet and got a phone number for them. I repeatedly stated I was not the person they were looking for,  but they refused to stop calling. I finally got an attorney  and after months of the attorney bickering with them, I did get a small money settlement. This was occurring when I was getting chemotherapy treatment for cancer and was very ill. My life was hell for months because of these practices. Collectors should be prohibited from concealing either their identity or their call-back numbers. This happened  because I had moved and was assigned a new number that evidently had belonged to a number of individuals who had outstanding debts. I was afraid to change my number again  because it would just usher in a new batch of collectors. There should also be much, much, much stiffer monetary penalties for violations. The guilty party in the above scenario was a national collection agency with huge annual revenues;  the piddly amount I was eventually paid was to them a tiny fraction of one cent compared to their annual revenues. I just happen to be an attorney myself, and ran their name on Pacer-- they had been sued over and over in state and federal court and had actually paid million dollar fines to state attorneys general--also just a small cost of doing business for them compared to their enormous annual revenues.

This is not about debt forgiveness,  its about declaring a debt neutral, no more penalties, fees or interest rate charges are applied to the debt, and the debtor agrees to pay off the debt in a reasonable manner, even if it takes 10 years to do so. __URL__",

You are correct, if the FDCPA remained the way it is currently it may be considered a violation. The FDCPA allegedly is geared to the \"least sophisticated individual\". However, I currently speak to many people that are not able to properly respond to a debt validation (even when they have a credible dispute). I am currently dealing with a 72-year old woman whose son \"stole\" her identity. He was convicted of fraud and deported for other credit cards that he took out in her name. She received a dunning notice and now is being sued on another card that she was not even aware of. Our experiences are just different. I once felt the same way as you when I was in commercial debt collection. I truly appreciate your response but you and I will have to disagree that \"he or she should be able to articulate that dispute\". I enjoyed reading your well thought out response and look forward to the continued debate.",

Currently, if you dispute a debt, the debt collector reports you to the CRAs  and your credit standing is adversely impacted; i.e., the damage is already done at that point. In other words, the notation on the credit report that the debt is disputed by the consumer is largely ignored by potential lenders, employers, landlords, etc. Thus, disputing the debt does nothing to prevent harm to the consumer. The debt collector and creditor threaten to report you to the CRAs as a coercive tactic to force you to pay a debt even though you might legitimately not owe the debt or the amount claimed to be owed. As for my proposal, I do not think this will lead to more litigation. Just the opposite. If a consumer doesn't timely dispute the debt, then the debt can be deemed verified or substantiated. If, however, the debt is timely disputed, creditors and debt collectors will have to evaluate whether to initiate litigation and weigh the likelihood of prevailing at trial  and this may cause creditors and debt collectors to be more judicious about which debts to take to trial. This proposal would also protect consumers from having their credit standing negatively impacted until after it is conclusively determined that a purported debt that is disputed is in fact owed and the amount of such debt is conclusively determined. As an alternative to my initial proposal, a rule could be adopted that would impose significant statutory penalties, treble damanages and recovery of attorney's fees against creditors, debt collectors and CRAs in the event the consumer can prove either the disputed debt doesn't exist or the amount of the debt is less than that claimed to be owed. This approach, however, places the burden of proof on the consumer and I feel strongly that the burden of proof should be on the creditors and debt collectors to affirmatively prove the existence and amount of any disputed debt before a consumer's credit report is adversely impacted.",

The solution to this is simple;  do not allow credit bureaus to ever list more than one entry for the same debt. Put the burden of accurate recordkeeping on the bureaus,  because they are the only entities who have a responsibility for accurate recordkeeping  and they are paid to keep accurate records. Currently the cost of sloppy systems is externalized to both creditors and borrowers, both of whom tend to re-externalize it to other creditors and borrowers in the form of higher costs. It is irrelevant whether these dual entries are caused by negligence, incompetence, or malice on the part of the creditor or collector  because it is the responsibility of the credit reporting agency to make this practice impossible. Adding steep fines for double reporting would incentivize CRA's to police their systems so each debt only garners one entry. Since CRA's are immune from libel suits in most of the country  regulatory oversight is especially important. Conversely, clarifying that reporting agencies are not immune from state libel laws -- that regulatory authority is in addition to state defamation law -- would also quickly incentivize more accurate reporting.",

I would also like there to be a rule that specifically distinguishes between a \"hard pull\" and a \"soft pull\" credit inquiry. I have been opted out of promotional marketing via the __URL__ website for years. I do not have debt and have never had debt. What I do have is a common name,  and so from time to time I will have various debt collectors and debt buyers \"soft pulling\" my credit reports while they are trying to locate whomever they are trying to locate. This should not be allowed even if the debt is still collectable and within the SOL. No debt collector has a \"permissible purpose\" to just randomly \"soft pull\" my credit reports just because I have a common name. As far as being outside the SOL and time-barred debts: no debt collector and debt owners/debt buyers should be allowed to pull someone\"s credit report  since they can't legally sue the debtor outside of the SOL. So there is no need to continue pulling someone\"s credit report. As far as the \"hard pull\" \"soft pull\" is concerned: There needs to be specific language that prohibits any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates from performing \"hard pull\" credit report inquiries. The FCRA makes it clear what \"permissible purposes\" are  but it does not specifically state or distinguish between a \"hard pull\" and a \"soft pull\" credit inquiry. A \"hard pull\" is a consumer-initiated request for an extension of credit. Anything other than a consumer-initiated request is a \"soft pull.\" But time and time again, I have friends, family members, and online forum members, tell me and show me that a debt collector or a debt owner/debt buyer has \"hard pulled\" their credit report. And some of these times are when the debt is time-barred from being outside the SOL and also from the Credit Reporting Time Period. This is unacceptable. A \"hard pull\" will decrease a consumers credit score and will be visible for up to 25 months to anyone who does have a legitimate permissible purpose to view that consumer\"s credit report Making a \"hard pull\" on a debtor\"s credit report could be a violation of the FDCPA in the privacy of the debtor. Any debt collectors, debt owners/debt buyers, and other related affiliates should be prohibited from doing \"hard pulls\"  and the CFPB should make it absolutely clear. www.optoutprescreen.com __URL__",

Debt Defaults and Debt Collections are a one sided issue in which judges have been constrained to simply determine if a default has occurred, or not. The lawyers primarily work with strategic defaulters because S.D.'s have some source of money or income available to pay both the attorney and a partial portion of the debt. Involuntary Defaulters are left to fend for themselves because they don't have money to pay a lawyer. Debt Neutrality, in which an involuntary defaulter agrees they owe the debt and simply want's to be able to pay it down based on the amount the debt was at the time of the default, with no more penalties, interest rate charges, or fees, even if it takes 10 years to pay off the debt, would possibly alleviate a large amount of unnecessary court cases. And of course, once the very modest initial payments were set up, the account would no longer register as a negative on a debtor's credit score or credit rating. And to safeguard fraud, the debtor would not be able to keep borrowing larger and larger amounts of money until after their defaults were paid in full. It's a very logical solution in my opinion. Judges should be able to use logic to solve the growing backlog of credit card default cases.",

For certain there are some people who knew full well they would have collections items and are playing dumb (and not doing so very well). But many of them had no clue, and 90% of those collections are medical in nature. If the CFPB truly is about protecting the interests of the consumer, then the debt collection process needs to be simplified drastically in regard to collection items (medical, utilities, etc.). after 60 days of non-payment, the account can be closed. The creditor sends a certified letter to the last known address of the debtor, informing them they have 30 days to bring the account current or make other payment arrangements,  or the account will be turned over to a collection agency. Said letter also needs to contain the contact information for that collection agency, so they know in advance who to contact if they don't respond within 30 days. Yes, a lot of those letters will be returned undeliverable or will end up in someone else's hands. But that would demonstrate a good faith effort by the creditors to work with the debtors before passing the buck to a collection agency.

I said \"I have never received a bill.\" He said \"really?\" I said , \"yes\" He said, \"Call accounting at the hospital\". I called the hospital and they said to talk to my insurance company. I called my 2nd insurance company and they said both the first and the second insurance company had paid the hospital. The 2nd insurance company said I did owe money on the bill, something like $1.08. A bill collection company had been hired to collect $1.08 for which I had never received a bill! I asked both insurance companies to send me additional copies of the Explanation of Benefits. When I received the copies, I sent them to the billing department of the hospital with a check for the amount that the 2nd insurance company said I owed. I never did receive a bill. Nor was i warned it might go to a collection agency. A collection agency was hired for an amount just slightly over $1.00. Because of this experience, I do not plan ever to use this hospital again if I can help it.

I knew I had made \"x\" number of principal payments on my loan  and my lender claimed I had made \"y\" number of principal payments. I had emails and cancelled checks supporting the \"x\" number of payments  and the history from my issuing bank also supported my case and dates. My lender refused to investigate, saying they had done everything just as I asked and I had instructed them to apply \"y\" number of payments to principal. They had no documentation to back up this assertion  (their documentation was just a statement of how they processed my payments, not any of my direction). In order to get my situation fixed, I had to find the specific payment the lender misapplied from their own records, which were a mess due to the amount of errors they had made. This was not an easy task, as it was time consuming and the lenders records were not exactly layperson friendly reading. A couple of things... the average joe may not be able to read an institution's financial recordkeeping. In my case, my bank's history, cancelled checks and emails were all sufficient proof to my mind and the extent of consumer responsibility.

        "paragraph": "This is a fantastic idea. Right now, debt buyers buy debt for an average price of 4 cents on the dollar. Many debts are bought for 2-4 cents on the dollar and many other debts are given away for free. If I were an original creditor, would like to get the most money I could for a debt owed to me. And so if I could get 10 cents on the dollar directly from the debtor, rather than 4 cents on the dollar from a debt buyer, then I would see no reason not to offer a significantly reduced debt settlement rate to the debtor (or as you call it, letting consumers bid on their own debt). Right now, original creditors offer no significant reduced rate to debtor before selling for 4 cents on the dollar. Most creditors barely even offer debtors 10% off the debt as a settlement offer. Sure, a creditor could more quickly offload portfolios to debt buyers by selling them at 4 cents on the dollar. But creditors could also make way more money offering a onetime chance at 10 cents on the dollar (or something really attractive but still more than 4 cents on the dollar). Perhaps the CFPB should make a rule that allows consumers/debtors the chance to receive a onetime offer that is valid for only X amount of days (maybe 45 days) from the date of the letter sent from their creditors of a significantly reduced rate. The offer would only be valid for a short amount of time and would also inform the consumer that, should the consumer not accept the offer, the creditor would then turn it over to a debt buyer. This letter would only be sent if the creditor\"s intentions are to sell the debt and not just another attempt to collect. So that this way it gives the consumer one final chance to clear the debt owed and the creditors also have less loss and more profits and would be able to lend to more consumers, give better rates to consumers, and stimulate the economy. Because more money that is changing hands at higher values (10 cents on the dollar vs. 4 cents on the dollar) instead of sitting in the accounts receivable section waiting to be collected (one day, if ever) stimulates the economy. This rule would not negatively impact anything (or anyone) and only positively impacts everyone. One minor impact might be on the debt collection industry possibly receiving less debt in their portfolios that they buy, but this minor impact is offset by the large positive impacts on the economy.",

While insurance companies were paying out tens of millions of dollars to building owners who suffered damage because of 911  (which technically they should not have done  since this was an act of war which is NOT covered by most insurance plans),  the comptroller of the currency was DENYING insurance companies from competing with credit card companies in the credit card debt suspension insurance arena. The result was a credit card debt suspension insurance monopoly for the credit card companies with premiums that were overpriced by a factor of 1000% to 2000% The profit margin was so high for credit card debt suspension insurance that the CFPB actually had to fine the credit card companies OVER 500 MILLION DOLLARS in the summer of 2012 for overly aggressive credit card debt suspension insurance sales and marketing practices. I had warned about overpriced credit card debt suspension insurance back in 2008 with the creation of __URL__ but was never compensated for my efforts. It meant that MOST credit card defaults in the United States over the last 10 to 15 years were based on a fraudulent foundation of obscenely over priced credit card debt suspension insurance that consumers could not afford to keep purchasing. Consumers were literally paying for 5 years worth of credit card debt suspension insurance but only receiving 3-5 months worth of coverage! Most of the times that a judge was declaring a credit card default, they were propping up the overpricing of a monopolistic credit card debt suspension insurance policy that did not fairly give consumers the most obvious way to protect themselves from a default that was caused by life changing event We could literally fix the U.S. economy almost overnight by doing the right thing. First acknowledge credit card debt suspension insurance fraud that the credit card companies have perpetrated on the american people over the past 10 to 15 years  and as retribution reduce all consumer credit card debt by approximately 65%. Then raise the monthly minimum payment on the remaining 35% from 2% to 5%  so the monthly payment remains roughly the same but consumers feel their debt more easily going forward. The comptroller of the currency tried to get credit card companies to raise their monthly minimum payment requirements from 2% to 4 or 5% back around 2005 but relented when it became obvious too many people would default. By reducing consumer credit card debt by 65% as a form of reparations for debt suspension insurance fraud consumers suddenly have a lot less debt BUT still have to make a similar monthly payments. However MORE of that monthly payment goes towards paying down the actual debt rather than the cesspool known as ever expanding interest rate charges.",

The facts are consumers need to reach out and communicate to a lender, agency, or debt buyer rather than not communicating at all. Debts not repaid usually result in the debt being charged off  so the consumer had a minimum of 180 days to seek alternative repayment options. Lenders, collection agencies and debt buyers have a right to sue a legal debt just like the IRS. Keep in mind that judgments last longer than open credit accounts looking at statute of limitations. To BillBatram's comment that filing bankruptcy creates hell as far as FICO scores, consumers face that issue with non payment of debt and bankruptcy is an alternative for a consumer to have a fresh start. That was the intent of the bankruptcy law and still is. Consumers with little or no hope to repay debts care more about moving forward with their lives instead of worrying about FICO SCORES.",

We cannot allow expediency to deny us such fundamental rights. I believe there is such a thing as the Gideon Decision by the Supreme Court that provides for any accused to an adequate defence, so if any debt-collector or creditor for that matter denies the alleged debtor the right to have his day in court or to a proper defence, then the CFPB attorneys should come down hard on such violators. The principle behind any rules promulgated by the CFPB must ensure that no alleged debtor get bullied into paying up or blind-sided by the court into doing so. Sometimes, there are reasons why the outstanding bills are not paid  and the consumer should be allowed to confront the creditor to resolve any complaints by the consumer before the bills are paid. It's a very straight-forward and simple situation actually. All the CFB needs to do is to enact basic regulations that protects the consumer and stipulates very clearly that the burden of proof must be borne by the creditor before any debt-collector can be engaged to pursue such debts. The debt-collector must only be allowed to follow specific guidelines when doing so and the matter should be referred to a small claims court to have both sides plead their case before the court issues a ruling, rather than to allow the claim to be reported to a credit reporting agency  that will destroy the credit score or rating of the consumer without his knowledge, which is absolutely wrong. Only lawful and valid debts, i.e. when a judgment order has been made, should be allowed to be reported to any credit reporting agency, to avoid creditors and debt-collectors from using such agencies to damage the interests of alleged debtors with unfounded or unproven debts.",

All of the spam experts all say not to open emails that are spam or potential spam,  because the spammers are so good at manipulating and getting around the privacy/security settings and force the recipients email client to inform the sender of when/if an email was opened. Also, I do not like the idea that collectors can insert links in emails. The more unscrupulous collectors and unscrupulous employees can insert links that are harmful to the security of the user\"s computers and offensive to the recipients (like pornographic material). Just think about how many collectors still (even after all of the lawsuits) use offensive and abusive language over the telephone, just think about what kind of harm these bad apples would be able to do with emails. I also I do not like the emails  because of the ease with which collection companies can sell the email lists to marketers. Many decades ago, one of my neighbors was a debt collector. She would tell me that if they couldn't get money out of the debtors then we make money off of them by selling your address and personal information to marketing companies. I have huge concerns for allowing collectors from using emails. Any rules that allow collectors to use email should come with deliberate care and attention to the privacy/security, materials and content, and the restriction of selling email lists. I also worry about true and accurate identification of emails. Spammers/hackers are able to manipulate how emails are presented and the name of the email address that they send with. there should also be rules restricting collectors are manipulating and spoofing their email addresses.",

A person can be buy a $1,000 top of the line television set and only have a 20 or 25 dollar payment due the next month. That's credit card crack in my opinion. Financial Literacy could be a warning printed in bold letters on every credit card agreement warning how credit cards purposely have low monthly minimum payments to lure one into more and more debt, how credit card companies have no compassion for life changing events, and that credit card companies are overcharging for credit card debt suspension insurance by a factor of up to 2,000%. Put those three warnings on every agreement in bold letters,  and two things happen, customers have a better chance of becoming financially literate,  and it also is an admission of fraud by the credit card companies for all the prior agreements already in place.

I believe the issue is whether a third party debt collector or debt buyer should report an account to a credit reporting agency which would overlap the original lender's last report on the consumer account. In my opinion they should not. I have seen confusion due to lack of rule clarity. For example, if a consumer files a bankruptcy petition who should report that event?

This leaves a void as to the particular status after the account was charged off. As accounts are outsourced or purchased  the reliance of information resides on the system of record and NOT the charge off system. The third problem involves a consumer who has more than one account with the original lender so the risk of one account going to a different agency or debt buyer is highly likely. Even if access by the debt buyer and collector is available, the events that took place on the account are normally not recorded in the system of record and the charge off system may have been decommissioned. As to the issue of credit reporting of disputes depends upon whether an agency or debt buyer furnish data to a credit reporting agency. The amount of consumer data currently and in the past reported to credit reporting agencies may not be accurate specific to charged off accounts and to require a chain of title would be expensive  and the likely hood of accuracy would still not be achieved.

I explained that was probably not likely  because I am a Caregiver and I would have been the only one to answer the door and I did not get any service. I had to pay to file a response and was late by one day, andthen had to challenge the default because of the non service. The judge agreed that there had been no valid subservice  based on the fact that the service company used the most generic \"guess\" they could come up with, a women in her mid 30's to late 40's, around 5 foot 4 inches, weight around 130 pounds to 150 pounds. That is about as generic of a description as one could give,  and it was completely wrong. because that person did not exist. They even made up a name of someone I had never heard of and when I googled the name, could not find it anywhere on the internet. The second time a false subservice happened, a very similar description was given as the first time,  and the alleged subservice recipient was identified as \"Jane Doe\". I would like to point how dangerous these lies are on another level. I exclusively have been providing CareGiving services for my parents, no one else has. By lying and introducing these lies into a court document, anytime in the future I could be accused of exposing my parents to a person at our residence who never even existed. I was also somewhat frozen by this level of dishonesty because on the rare occasion when I had to sue someone, I followed the law and had the service performed legally and properly.
